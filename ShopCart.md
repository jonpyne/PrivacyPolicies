<h1>Shop Cart Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Updated: 1 June 2025</p>
<h2>Personal Data</h2>
  <p>Shop Cart is a shopping app. It stores only the data you enter into it, and only ever on your device. Unless you choose to back this data up to the remote location—your device's Download folder—this data cannot be accessed by other applications. No information is transmitted anywhere by the app. Neither to us, or to a third party. I do not use Google Analytics. I do not serve you advertising. I just want you to enjoy the app.</p>
<h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app requires you to grant a storage permission that does allow it read access to other locations on your device. This is so that it can load your backup data when you choose to restore from the Download folder. And for no other purpose.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any privacy concerns, or problems with the app, please email me at support@twelfthnight.dev.</p>
