<h1>Shop Cart Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Updated: 9 June 2025</p>
<h2>Personal Data</h2>
  <p>Shop Cart is designed to make your shopping experience easier—without compromising your privacy. All information you enter is stored solely on your device and never leaves it. Unless you explicitly choose to export a backup to your Downloads folder, your data remains completely private and inaccessible to other applications.</p>
  <p>The app does not transmit any of your personal data—neither to me nor to any third party.</p>
  <p>To help improve performance and reliability, I use Google Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics. These tools collect anonymous usage statistics and crash reports. No personally identifiable information is gathered.</p>
  <p>I'm not here to collect your data. I’m here to build something useful—and I hope you enjoy using Shop Cart.</p>
<h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app requires you to grant a storage permission that does allow it read access to other locations on your device. This is so that it can load your backup data when you choose to restore from the Download folder. And for no other purpose.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any privacy concerns, or problems with the app, please email me at support@twelfthnight.dev.</p>
